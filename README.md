# Single-Cycle-Processor for ECEN 350
This is a single cycle ARMv8 processor implemented using Verilog created in my ECEN 350 class. 

SingleCycleProcTest.v is used to test the functionality of the processor by using the instructions in InstructionMemory.v. 

This code is based on files provided by Dr. Gratz and TA's.

All files have contributions by me.
